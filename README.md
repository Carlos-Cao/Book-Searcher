<h2> Book Searcher </h2>

<br>
Book Searcher uses Google Bookâ€™s API to aggregate book titles based on search terms, to get the book image, title, authors, date published, published by and description, with up to 30 results available. <br> 
<br>
Built with TypeScript and React. <br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> No API key is needed.

<h2> Dev-Ops Pipelines </h2>

<ul>
<li> I used Azure DevOps to set up continuous deployment to my GitHub Repository, by running the azure-pipelines.yml script. With every change commited and pushed to the master or develop branch, the script automatically updates and deploys the latest changes to the live server. </li>
</ul>
